# Vegetable Classification Project

## Overview
The **Vegetable Classification Project** is a machine learning initiative aimed at categorizing vegetables based on their nutritional properties. By leveraging features such as vitamin A, vitamin C, and fiber content, this project builds a predictive model to classify vegetables into categories like *leafy greens*, *root vegetables*, and *fruits*. This repository contains all necessary code, dataset, and visualizations required to train, test, and deploy the classification model.

## Features
- Classification of vegetables into categories using their nutritional profiles.
- Implementation of a Decision Tree Classifier for predictive modeling.
- Confusion matrix and other metrics to evaluate model accuracy.
- Scalable and adaptable to additional features or data.

## Technologies
This project is built using:
- **Python**: A versatile programming language for data science and machine learning.
- **Pandas**: For dataset loading and preprocessing.
- **Scikit-learn**: To build and evaluate the machine learning model.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For visualizing model performance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
