# Vegetable Classification Project

## Overview
The **Vegetable Classification Project** is a machine learning initiative aimed at categorizing vegetables based on their nutritional properties. By leveraging features such as vitamin A, vitamin C, and fiber content, this project builds a predictive model to classify vegetables into categories like *leafy greens*, *root vegetables*, and *fruits*. This repository contains all necessary code, dataset, and visualizations required to train, test, and deploy the classification model.

## Features
- Classification of vegetables into categories using their nutritional profiles.
- Implementation of a Decision Tree Classifier for predictive modeling.
- Confusion matrix and other metrics to evaluate model accuracy.
- Scalable and adaptable to additional features or data.

## Technologies
This project is built using:
- **Python**: A versatile programming language for data science and machine learning.
- **Pandas**: For dataset loading and preprocessing.
- **Scikit-learn**: To build and evaluate the machine learning model.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For visualizing model performance.

## Usage
- Input nutritional values (e.g., vitamin A, vitamin C, fiber) to predict the category of a vegetable.
- Customize the script to adapt to new datasets or additional features.
- Evaluate the predictions and fine-tune the model if necessary.

## Visualization
- The project generates a confusion matrix heatmap to visualize the classification results.
- Heatmaps provide clear insights into correct and incorrect predictions, helping to improve model accuracy.
- Use visualization tools like Seaborn and Matplotlib to explore trends and patterns in the data.

## Contribution
Contributions are encouraged! You can:
- Fork the repository to make your improvements.
- Submit pull requests to add new features or enhance the existing code.
- Report issues or suggest ideas to make this project better.
